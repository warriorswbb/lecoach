# Basketball Analytics Multi-Agent System: Design Document

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
To create an AI-powered basketball analytics system that can answer complex questions about basketball games by breaking down the reasoning process across multiple specialized agents.

### 1.2 Objectives
Provide natural language interface for querying basketball data
Support complex analytical questions about game events, player performance, and team statistics
Ensure accurate SQL generation against existing database schema
Present insights with appropriate context and visualizations
Integrate seamlessly with existing game detail page

## 2. Architecture
### 2.1 High level architecture
UI Component (React) → API Endpoint (Next.js) → Coordinator Agent → Query Understanding Agent → SQL Generation Agent → Database (PostgreSQL) → Data Processing Agent → Response Generation Agent → back to UI.

### 2.2 Tech stack

Framework: Next.js (existing)
UI: React with Tailwind CSS (existing)
Database: PostgreSQL (existing)
AI Orchestration: LangChain.js
LLM Provider: OpenAI
API: REST endpoints for agent interaction

## 3. Agent Specifications

### 3.1 Orchestrator Agent
Purpose: Orchestrate the entire question-answering process

Inputs:
User question
Game context (gameId, teams, etc.)

Outputs:
Final response to user

Key Features:
Determines question type and routes to appropriate specialized agents
Manages state throughout the multi-agent process
Handles error cases and fallbacks
Coordinates parallel processing when appropriate

### 3.2 Query understanding agent
Purpose: Parse and analyze user questions about basketball games
Inputs:
Raw user question
Game metadata (teams, date, etc.)

Outputs:
Structured query intent
Required data points
Analysis type classification

Key Features:
Basketball terminology recognition
Question type classification (scoring, player stats, team performance, etc.)
Identification of time periods of interest (quarters, game segments)
Entity extraction (player names, team references)

### 3.3 SQL Generation Agent

Purpose: Convert analytical requirements into executable SQL queries
Inputs:
Structured query intent
Database schema information

Outputs:
SQL query or queries to execute
Parameters for queries

Key Features:
Deep knowledge of database schema (from v1/db/models.py)
Complex query generation for time-series analysis
Query validation and optimization
Handles different question types with appropriate SQL patterns


### 3.4 Data Processing Agent

Purpose: Process query results and perform advanced analytics

Inputs:
Raw database query results
Analysis requirements

Outputs:
Processed insights
Calculation results
Data prepared for visualization

Key Features:
Statistical analysis functions
Comparative analysis between players/teams
Data transformation for visualization


### 3.5 Reponse Generation Agent

Purpose: Create natural language responses with insights and visualizations
Inputs:
Processed analytics results
Original question context
Outputs:
Natural language response
Visualization specifications
Key Features:
Natural language generation focused on basketball analytics
Contextual response formatting
Identification of key insights to highlight
Recommendations for visualizations

## 4. Data Flow
### 4.1 Question Processing Flow
User submits question via UI
Question and game context passed to Coordinator Agent
Coordinator routes to Query Understanding Agent
Query Understanding identifies intent and required data
SQL Generation Agent creates appropriate database queries
Queries execute against PostgreSQL database
Results passed to Data Processing Agent for analysis
Processed insights passed to Response Generation Agent
Final response returned to UI for display


## 5. Database Integration
### 5.1 Database Schema Analysis

Key tables from v1/db/models.py:
games: Game metadata (teams, scores, date)
teams: Team information
players: Player information
play_by_play: Detailed game events with timestamps
Additional statistics tables

### 5.2 Database Connection
Leverage existing connection in ui/src/lib/db.ts:
Reuse PostgreSQL pool configuration
Add new query functions for analytics
Ensure proper error handling and connection management


## 6. API Design
### 6.1 Endpoints
POST /api/games/:gameId/ask
Purpose: Submit a basketball analytics question

Request Body:

  {
    question: string;
  }

Response:

  {
    answer: string;
    visualizationType?: 'chart' | 'highlight' | 'comparison';
    visualizationData?: any;
    confidence: number;
    executionTime: number;
  }

### 6.2 API Implementation
Location: ui/src/app/api/games/[gameId]/ask/route.ts
Implements Next.js API Routes pattern
Connects to LangChain orchestration layer
Handles authentication if needed
Manages response formatting


## 7. UI Integration
### 7.1 Analytics Chat Component
New component: ui/src/components/AnalyticsChat.tsx
Chat interface for asking questions
Displays responses with appropriate formatting
Renders visualizations based on response
Maintains chat history

7.2 Game Page Integration
Update: ui/src/app/games/[gameId]/page.tsx
Add Analytics Chat component to the existing layout
Position in an expandable panel or dedicated section
Style consistently with existing dark theme
7.3 Visualization Integration
Leverage existing AreaChartComponent for data visualization
Add additional visualization types as needed
Ensure consistent styling with the current design system


## 8. Implementation Plan
### 8.1 Phase 1: Core Agent Setup
Create basic agent framework
Implement coordinator and query understanding agents
Set up basic communication patterns

### 8.2 Phase 2: Database Integration
Implement SQL generation agent
Create database connection layer
Test query generation and execution

### 8.3 Phase 3: Analysis and Response
Implement data processing agent
2. Create response generation agent
Add visualization selection logic

### 8.4 Phase 4: UI Integration
Create API endpoints
Develop chat UI component
Integrate with game detail page

### 8.5 Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
Create test suite for common basketball questions
Measure accuracy and performance
Refine agent behaviors based on results
